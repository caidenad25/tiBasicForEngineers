### Installation
To install the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

- Download the desired file from **Releases** (for older versions) or **bin** (for the current version)
- Download and install [TI Connect™ Software](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw)
- Plug your calculator into the same machine as TI Connect™ Software
- Open TI Connect™ Software and navigate to the Program Editor workspace
- Click "Open Program"
- Select the program.8xp file you downloaded in step 1 (i.e. CONVERT.8xp)
- Select the "Send" icon in the toolbar to go to the send menu
- Make sure the correct calculator is selected and storage set to RAM
- Wait until the calculator is done receiving and unplug

### Usage
To use the programs, follow these steps:

- Click the "PRGM" button on your calculator
- Select the new program using either (a) the arrows or (b) the menu item number

### Programs
The programs included are relatively self-explanatory as to what gets calculated by each. For obvious reasons, no 3D graphing can occur on the TI-84 Plus CE as this is not within the model's specifications.
Note: many of the release descriptions for the first versions uploaded here have heavy markdown presence, which only renders on desktop browsers, not mobile.

- **Master** - contains a variety of capabilities and elementary formulas
- **Convert** - allows conversion of various units such as length and volume
- **Unit Circle** - displays an interactive unit circle with values
- **Statics** - calculates values for statics, targets 3D scenarios
- **Physics** - calculates kinematics and other elementary physics principles
- **Econ** - performs elementary and specific economics calculations
- **Stats** - assists the calculation of statistical values, specific to elementary statistics
- **Civil** - convert between decimal degrees and DMS format
- **Cleaner** - cleans most variables from the RAM
- **Timer** - simple timer program (limit 59:59)
